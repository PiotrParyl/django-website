# About Project

The project is based on the book by Matthes Eric. It is a project written in Django. From my perspective, it is interesting because previously web developing I started with Flask framework. In retrospect, I consider it a good practice, because the principle is very similar. An interesting advantage is that Django itself builds us the basis of the project, and you don't have to create the templates file once again.
